    story: "Hello, I'm Emrah! 👋🏻\n\nI am from Turkey. I am a 4th-year student of Computer Engineering at Atatürk University.\n\nI am currently studying in the field of Cyber ​​Security. I also work in a private company on Cyber ​​Security. I recently joined the amazing world of Swift.\n\nYou see the application called entropy, where I combined the powerful features of Swift UI with the concept of cyber-security.  Today's one of the most important problems is that company employees or people do not choose a strong password.\n\nAs a result, attackers can crack weak passwords with techniques such as dictionary attacks and brute force attacks. In such a scenario, both companies and individuals may experience permanent losses.\n\nWith the swift playground called Entropy, I aimed to create cyber security awareness for users. By experiencing how strong a password can be created and how long will it take to be cracked, the user will understand the importance of the password and increase the security level.👍🏻\n\nHave Fun ! 🎯"
